This is an import of the pxlib library and pxview tool, written by Uwe
Steinmann, downloaded from:

    http://pxlib.sourceforge.net/
    http://pxlib.sourceforge.net/pxview.html

This repo is just so that I can apply my own minor modernizations and
updates (e.g., so that I can get (semi-)clean builds with modern GNU
Autotools and compilers in September of 2015).
